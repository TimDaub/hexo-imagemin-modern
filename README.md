# Deprecation: 2023-01-27: I stopped using hexo and so this package isn't further maintained. Feel free to fork it and maintain by yourself considering the license.
# hexo-imagemin-modern for [Hexo](https://hexo.io)
> Minify images with [imagemin](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin).

**Supported Image Formats:** gif, jpeg, png, svg

## Install
```bash
$ npm install hexo-imagemin-modern
```

No configuration is required.

### Note

- `hexo-imagemin-modern` isn't run when calling `hexo serve` as this would
  introduce significant lag into debugging. It is, however, run e.g. on
  deployment with `hexo deploy`.
